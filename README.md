# Pet Adoption page
I have created this website using the basics of HTML and CSS. 
# Description
To create this page, I have used the photo of cat and dog which was easily available on google. 
The images are also in my repo in the folder image_assests for the help. 
I have entered the basic information of the pet in the page. 
I tried to keep it as simple as possible. 
I created the cards such that each card contains the information of apecific pet.
